# PANORAMA
Developed two panoramic views from drone footage using OpenCV's Stitcher for a top-down panorama and a manual SIFT-based approach for an angled perspective. Demonstrated proficiency in image stitching, feature detection, and homography, leveraging OpenCV and Python to automate and control the panorama creation process.
